It\'s a server side generated static page generated from github repository. Netlifly bulds it automaticly every time the repo is changed and serves in a 100% static form. Post are stored as local Markdown files.</p>\n<p>The main goal of this blog was to do something fun and productive with Vue.js. And while in the process I lerned absolutely nothing about this fascinating frintend framework I can safely say that Gridsome.js while currently far from production-ready state is an awesome piece of technology.</p>\n<h2 id="more-about-gridsome"><a href="#more-about-gridsome" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>More about Gridsome</h2>\n<p>Gridsome itself is based around Vue.js supplemented by GraphQL with schemas written using specific Gridsome plugins (no pripor GraphQL knowledge required.) It\'s a Vue eqivalent (copy?) of Gatsby.je itself using React.js.  It is a static website generator. During development we use node.js server with GrapQL, Vue.js and Webpack and once finalized eveything is digested into 100% static, extrely fast end product.</p>\n',date:"14 January, 2019"}}}}}]);
